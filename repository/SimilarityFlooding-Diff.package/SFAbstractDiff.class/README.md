I represent an abstract difference computation engine.

I hold all the stuff that a diff should hold by default:
- a #baseModel which is the initial version of the model
- a #targetModel which is the new version of the model.
- a set of #changes which are generated by my #computeDiff method.

I define the interface any diff should implement, that is to say:
- #computeDiff computes the difference and returns the results,
