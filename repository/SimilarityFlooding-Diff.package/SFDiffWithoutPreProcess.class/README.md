I do the same thing as my parent class but without the pre-process and other optimizations.

Therefore, I take a lot more time to process my input and give less good results...

I only exist to be able to compare the results of SFDiff and find out the impact of SFDiff optimizations.

I SHOULD NOT BE USED FOR REAL!
